vehicle damage detection &amp; repair estimation

This is an implementation of Mask R-CNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of car in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet50/ResNet101 backbone.\

# Aim
To build a custom Mask R-CNN model that can detect the area of damage on a car or military vehicle.
The rationale for such a model is that it can be used by:
- insurance companies for faster processing of claims if users can upload pics and they can assess damage from them.
- lenders if they are underwriting a car loan especially for a used car
- fleet managmeent teams
